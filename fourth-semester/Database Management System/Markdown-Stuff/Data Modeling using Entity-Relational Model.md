#### Data Modeling using Entity-Relational Model

###### Assignment 3

###### Question

What are the components of ER diagram? Explain the functions of various symbols used in ER diagram.

###### Answer

An ER diagram, or entity-relationship diagram, is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other in a database. It consists of various components, including entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality. Here is an overview of the components of an ER diagram:

1. Entities: Entities are objects or concepts that are important to the database. They are represented by rectangles in an ER diagram.
2. Attributes: Attributes are characteristics or properties of entities. They are represented by ovals connected to the corresponding entity rectangle.
3. Relationships: Relationships are the connections between entities. They are represented by diamonds connected to the corresponding entity rectangles.
4. Cardinality: Cardinality describes the number of instances of one entity that are related to another entity. It is represented by lines with symbols, such as a crow's foot, that indicate the type of relationship.

Here are the functions of various symbols used in an ER diagram:

1. Rectangle: Represents an entity. The name of the entity is usually written inside the rectangle.
2. Oval: Represents an attribute. The name of the attribute is usually written inside the oval.
3. Diamond: Represents a relationship. The name of the relationship is usually written inside the diamond.
4. Crow's foot: Represents the cardinality of a relationship. The crow's foot symbol on the end of a line indicates the type of relationship, such as one-to-many or many-to-many.
5. Double lines: Represents a strong relationship between entities.
6. Dashed lines: Represents a weak relationship between entities.

In summary, an ER diagram is a visual representation of the database's structure, showing entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinality. The symbols used in an ER diagram help to illustrate the relationships and constraints between different components of the database.

###### Question

Explain the use of primary key and foreign key in DBMS with example. What is the role of foreign key?

###### Answer

In a database management system (DBMS), a primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. A foreign key, on the other hand, is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. Here's an explanation of how primary and foreign keys work, along with an example:

Primary Key: A primary key is used to uniquely identify each record in a table. It must be unique for each record in the table and cannot contain any null values. In most cases, a primary key is created using an auto-incrementing integer value. For example, in a table of employees, the primary key might be the employee ID number.

Example: Consider a table named "Customers" with the following columns: customer_id, customer_name, customer_email, and customer_phone. The customer_id column would be the primary key, as it would uniquely identify each customer record in the table.

Foreign Key: A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It creates a relationship between two tables, allowing them to be joined together in queries. The foreign key field in one table must have the same data type as the primary key field it references in the other table.

Example: Consider another table named "Orders" with the following columns: order_id, order_date, order_amount, and customer_id. In this example, the customer_id column in the Orders table would be a foreign key, as it refers to the customer_id primary key in the Customers table. This relationship allows us to link customer records to their respective order records, making it easy to retrieve information about a customer's orders.

Role of Foreign Key: The role of a foreign key is to maintain referential integrity between two tables in a database. This means that when a foreign key references a primary key in another table, it ensures that there is a corresponding record in the other table. It also ensures that any updates or deletes made to the primary key are cascaded to the foreign key, maintaining the consistency of data between the two tables. In other words, foreign keys ensure that related data is correctly linked and maintained, preventing inconsistencies and errors in the database.

###### Question

What is the difference between Entities and Entity set? Explain with an example.

###### Answer

| Entities                                                     | Entity Sets                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entities are individual objects or concepts that are distinguishable from each other. | Entity sets are collections of entities that share common attributes. |
| An entity represents a single occurrence of a class or type of object. | An entity set represents a group of related entities that share common characteristics. |
| Entities are often represented as instances of a class in object-oriented programming. | Entity sets are often represented as tables in a database.   |
| Example: A person, a car, a book, a company, etc.            | Example: A collection of books, a group of employees, a set of customers, etc. |

###### Question 

What do you mean by ER model? Explain strong and weak entity.

###### Answer

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a data modeling technique used to describe the relationships between different entities in a system. The model uses entities, attributes, and relationships to represent the real-world objects and their interactions. Entities represent objects or concepts, attributes represent properties of entities, and relationships represent the connections between entities.

A strong entity is an entity that exists independently of other entities, meaning it has its own unique identifier or primary key. A strong entity can exist on its own and does not depend on any other entity to exist. For example, in a database of students, the "Student" entity is a strong entity as it has its own unique identifier such as a student ID.

On the other hand, a weak entity is an entity that depends on another entity, called the owner entity, for its existence. A weak entity does not have its own unique identifier, and instead, its existence is defined by its relationship with the owner entity. For example, in a database of orders, the "Order Detail" entity is a weak entity as it does not have its own unique identifier but instead, its existence depends on the "Order" entity. The "Order" entity is the owner entity, and it has a primary key that is used to identify and link to the corresponding "Order Detail" entities.

In summary, a strong entity can exist on its own and has its own unique identifier, while a weak entity depends on another entity for its existence and does not have its own unique identifier.
