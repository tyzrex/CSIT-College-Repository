###### Question

Difference between data security and integrity with example. 

###### Answer

|      | Data Security                                                | Data Integrity                                               |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access or breaches | Focuses on ensuring data is accurate, complete, and consistent |
| 2    | Examples include encryption, firewalls, access controls, and authentication | Examples include checksums, digital signatures, data validation, and error detection and correction |
| 3    | Goal is to prevent data from being stolen, leaked, or compromised | Goal is to prevent data from being altered, corrupted, or deleted |
| 4    | Important for protecting sensitive or confidential information, such as personal or financial data | Important for maintaining the trustworthiness and reliability of data, such as scientific or research data |
| 5    | Data security measures often involve software and hardware solutions | Data integrity measures often involve data management and validation processes |
| 6    | Data security breaches can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences | Data integrity issues can lead to errors, mistakes, and invalid results |

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between data security and data integrity:

Suppose you have a database that contains sensitive financial information, such as credit card numbers and bank account details. To ensure data security, you might implement access controls to restrict who can access the database, encryption to protect the data from hackers, and firewalls to prevent unauthorized access. However, even with these measures in place, you also need to ensure data integrity. This means making sure that the financial information in the database is accurate, complete, and consistent. For example, you might use checksums to verify that the data hasn't been altered or corrupted, or you might use data validation techniques to ensure that the data entered into the database is accurate and conforms to predefined rules. By ensuring both data security and data integrity, you can protect sensitive financial information and maintain the trust and reliability of the data.

###### Question

What is data integrity? Explain different types of integrity.

###### Answer

Data integrity is the concept of maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data over its entire lifecycle. This includes ensuring that data is complete, valid, and consistent, and that it has not been corrupted or modified in an unauthorized manner. Data integrity is important because inaccurate or inconsistent data can lead to errors, mistakes, and incorrect results, which can have serious consequences in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and research.

There are several different types of data integrity that are commonly used to ensure the quality of data:

1. Entity Integrity: This refers to ensuring that each record in a database has a unique identifier or primary key, and that it cannot be null or empty. This helps to prevent duplicate or missing data.
2. Referential Integrity: This refers to ensuring that relationships between tables in a database are maintained, and that any foreign keys or references are valid. For example, if a record in one table refers to a record in another table, the referenced record must exist and cannot be deleted or modified without updating the referencing record.
3. Domain Integrity: This refers to ensuring that the data in each field or column of a table conforms to a predefined set of rules or constraints. For example, a field that is supposed to contain numeric data should not contain alphabetic characters, and a field that is supposed to contain a date should not contain invalid dates.
4. User-Defined Integrity: This refers to additional rules or constraints that are defined by the user or application to ensure data quality. For example, a business might define rules for data entry, such as requiring a certain format for phone numbers or addresses.
5. Multi-Value Integrity: This refers to ensuring that fields or columns that contain multiple values or sets of data are properly structured and maintained. For example, a field that contains a list of values should not contain duplicates or inconsistent data.

###### Question

Define integrity constraints. Discuss domain constraint with suitable example.

###### Answer

Integrity constraints are rules or conditions that are defined in a database schema to ensure the correctness and consistency of data stored in the database. These constraints are enforced by the database management system (DBMS) and help to maintain the integrity of data by preventing invalid or inconsistent data from being entered into the database.

One type of integrity constraint is a domain constraint, which specifies the valid range of values that can be entered into a particular column or attribute of a table. For example, if a column is defined as an integer type, then only integer values within a certain range can be entered into that column. Similarly, if a column is defined as a character type, then only characters within a certain set of valid characters can be entered.

Here's an example of a domain constraint:

Suppose you have a table called "Students" in a school database, which contains information about the students enrolled in the school. One of the columns in this table is "Grade," which indicates the grade level of each student. To ensure that only valid grades are entered into this column, you could define a domain constraint that specifies the valid range of values for the "Grade" column. For example, you might define the "Grade" column as an integer type with a domain constraint that limits the valid values to the range of 1-12, which corresponds to the grades taught in the school. This would ensure that only valid grade values can be entered into the "Grade" column, and would prevent incorrect or invalid data from being entered into the database.

Overall, domain constraints are an important aspect of data integrity because they help to ensure that data entered into a database is consistent and valid, and can prevent errors and inconsistencies that can lead to incorrect results or decisions.
