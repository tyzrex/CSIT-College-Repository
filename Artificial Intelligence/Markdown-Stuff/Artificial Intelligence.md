###### Question 1

What is turing test approach? Explain in detail.

###### <u>Answer:</u>

The Turing Test assesses a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is comparable to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Alan Turing proposed it in 1950 as a method of determining whether a machine can think like a human. Despite its limitations, the Turing Test is still a popular and widely debated concept in the field of artificial intelligence.

The Turing Test requires a human evaluator to engage in a natural language conversation with both a human and a machine while not knowing which is which. If the machine successfully mimics human behavior to the point where the evaluator cannot tell the difference, it is said to have passed the Turing test.

To pass the Turing Test, an AI system need to own certain capabilities, inclusive of:

1. Natural language processing: The AI system must be able to understand and generate human-like language, including context and nuance.
2. Knowledge representation: Like human memory, the AI system must be able to store and retrieve information.
3. Problem solving: The AI system must be able to solve problems and respond to questions in the same way that humans do.
4. Adaptability: The AI system must be able to respond to changing circumstances and adjust its behavior as necessary.
5. Emotional intelligence: The AI system must understand and mimic human emotions and social cues.
6. Creativity: The AI system must be able to generate new ideas and solutions while also making decisions based on limited information.
7. Common sense: The AI system must have a fundamental understanding of the world and be able to reason about everyday situations in the same way that humans do.

These capabilities are necessary for an AI system to pass the Turing Test, but they are also challenging to develop, as they require the integration of multiple complex AI technologies and algorithms.

Despite its limitations, the Turing Test remains an important benchmark for evaluating the progress of AI systems. It continues to inspire new research and developments in the field, and serves as a useful starting point for discussions about the nature and potential of artificial intelligence.

The Turing Test, however, has also drawn criticism for its constrained application, as it only assesses a machine's capacity to mimic human behavior and not its true intellect or consciousness. This has prompted some experts to claim that the Turing Test is insufficient as a gauge of genuine AI and that future tests would need to be more thorough and sophisticated.

In conclusion, the Turing Test is still a core concept in the science of artificial intelligence and is still used to evaluate how far AI systems have come. Despite its drawbacks, it continues to spur new research and advancements in the area and serves as a helpful starting point for conversations about the nature and promise of artificial intelligence.

###### Question 2 

Explain history of Artificial Intelligence.

1943-1950: Birth of AI

- 1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts publish a paper on "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity." This is considered the first publication of the concept of artificial intelligence.
- 1950: Alan Turing publishes his paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which introduces the Turing test as a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

1951-1960: Early AI Research and Development

- 1951: The first AI program, called the Logic Theorist, is developed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon.
- 1956: The Dartmouth Conference, where the term "Artificial Intelligence" is first coined by John McCarthy, is held.
- 1958: John McCarthy develops the first AI language, LISP.

1961-1970: Progress in AI

- 1961: The first expert system, called Dendral, is developed by Edward Feigenbaum and Joshua Lederberg.
- 1966: ELIZA, a computer program that can carry on a conversation with a user, is developed by Joseph Weizenbaum.
- 1969: The first AI artificial hand, called the Stanford Arm, is developed by Victor Scheinman.

1971-1980: Decline of AI

- 1973: The Lighthill Report is published, which criticizes AI research and leads to a decrease in funding for AI projects.
- Overoptimistic expectations: The early years of AI research were marked by very optimistic expectations, with researchers and the general public anticipating that AI would achieve human-level intelligence and capabilities much faster than it actually did.

1981-1990: Resurgence of AI

- 1981: The Fifth Generation Computer Systems project is launched in Japan, with the goal of developing advanced AI systems.
- 1987: The first autonomous robot, called NavLab 1, is developed by Carnegie Mellon University.
- 1988: The first AI chess program, called Deep Thought, beats a human player.

1991-2000: AI Goes Mainstream

- **1995:** Computer scientist Richard Wallace developed the chatbot A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), inspired by Weizenbaum's ELIZA. What differentiated A.L.I.C.E. from ELIZA was the addition of natural language sample data collection.
- 1997: Deep Blue, an AI chess program developed by IBM, beats world champion Garry Kasparov.
- 1999: The first autonomous robots capable of exploring the depths of the ocean are developed.

2001-2010: Advancements in AI

- **2000:** An artificially intelligent humanoid robot, ASIMO was released by Honda. The robot is capable of walking as fast as humans and delivering trays to customers in restaurants.
- **2007: ImageNet**, a big database containing annotated images was assembled by Fei Fei Li, a computer science professor, and her colleagues. The database aimed to help in object recognition software research.

2011-Present: AI in Society

- 2014: Siri, a powerful personal assistant was released by Apple
- 2014: Google acquired deepmind for more AI related research
- 2015: Google's Deepmind team developed program Alphago beats the world champion in the game of Go.
- 2015: Google released TensorFlow a free and open source library for machine learning and AI
- 2015: Open AI was founded in october 2015.
- 2019: GPT-2 Language Model was released by Open AI
- 2020: Improved version of GPT-2 i.e GPT-3 was released in 2020:
